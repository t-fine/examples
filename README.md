# examples
Code examples you can use with Horizon.

Generic edge service examples are found, perhaps unsurpringly, in:
 - edge/services

Edge examples specific to the Kafka/Event Streams  are found in:
 - edge/evtstreams

Each example includes documentation on how to use the service with policy or pattern, and how to optionally create and publish your own version of the service.

In general to run the code from one of these examples:
 - cd into the directory
 - run *make*
